What is the Craps Dice Game?


Craps is a popular dice game typically played in a casino as well as informally. It is played with a pair of dice. Players bet on the outcome of the roll, or a series of rolls, of a pair of dice.

In the simplest form of the game, the player (also known as the shooter) wins if the sum of the two dice is 7 or 11 on the first roll. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll, the shooter loses. If the roll is any other value (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), that number becomes the "point". The shooter then continues to roll until they roll the point number again for a win, or roll a 7 and lose.
